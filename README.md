# About

LinguaML is a React Native app powered by the Google Vision API that allows users to automagically create custom flashcards using only a picture.

## Inspiration

Language acquisition is difficult - especially for transfer students, new immigrants, and tourists, sudden immersion in a foreign tongue can be overwhelming. We wanted to create a quick and easy way for language learners to create and collect flashcards from everyday life - and share them with similarly-minded friends too!

## What it does

With LinguaML, you can take a picture of anything - we mean anything - and get it converted into a flashcard containing the subject's name in your native language and your target language, as well as the picture you took. You can hear the words spoken out loud, share your cards with your friends via QR code, and even convert entire decks into other languages, in case your focus shifts!

# Getting Started

Everything you need to know to try and run a local version of LinguaML!

## Prerequisites

First, you will need `npm` or `yarn`, and you will need to install `react`, `react-native`. If you want to emulate this on a virtual Android or iOS environment, make sure you set up a virtual emulator and run it concurrently.

## Running

Clone this repository and run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all dependencies. To run on a local Android emulator, run `npx react-native run-android`. To run on a local iOS emulator, run `npx react-native run-ios`.
